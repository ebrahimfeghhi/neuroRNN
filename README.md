# neuroRNN
This respository is intended to serve as a flexible framework for training biologically plausible RNNs.
Some of the features I aim to provide are Dale's principle, adaptive time constants, and reciprocal connections between layers.
I am currently focusing on implementing Dale's principle and understanding its impact.
