# neuroRNN
This respository is intended to serve as a flexible framework for training biologically plausible RNNs.
Some of the features I aim to provide are Dale's Principle, Adaptive Time Constants, and Recipricol Connections between Layers
I am currently focusing on implementing Dale's Principle and understanding its impact.
