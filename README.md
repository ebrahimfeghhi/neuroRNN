# neuroRNN
This respository is intended to serve as a flexible framework for training biologically plausible RNNs.
Some of the features I aim to provide are Dale's principle, adaptive time constants, and reciprocal connections between layers.
I am currently focusing on implementing Dale's principle and understanding its impact.

To access the most up to date model, go to models/Neuro_RNN_JIT.py. Adaptive time constants and Dale's Principle are currently implemented.
